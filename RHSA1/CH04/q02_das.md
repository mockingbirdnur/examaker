Which command will output the first 10 lines of output from 'ls -t' and redirect the final result to a file?

+ `ls -t | head -n 10 > /tmp/ten-last-changed-files`
* `ls -t | head 10 > /tmp/ten-last-changed-files`
* `ls -t | head n 10 > /tmp/ten-last-changed-files`
* `ls -t | tail -s 10 > /tmp/ten-last-changed-files`
* `ls -T | head -a 10 > /tmp/ten-last-changed-files`
